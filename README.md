# Churn Prediction & Customer Clustering

📊 **Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn and segmenting users into behavior-based clusters. Using ML models and clustering techniques, the project identifies high-risk customer groups and provides insights for targeted retention strategies.

⚙️ **Tech Stack**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- ML Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests  
- Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering  
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

🚀 **Key Features**
- Built churn prediction models with accuracy benchmarking across classifiers.  
- Extracted key drivers of churn from customer interaction and usage data.  
- Applied K-Means and hierarchical clustering to identify customer segments.  
- Visualized churn risk across clusters for actionable retention strategies.

📈 **Results**
- Logistic Regression achieved **XX% accuracy** (replace with your actual number).  
- Identified top 3 churn risk features (e.g., low activity, high complaints, short tenure).  
- Segmented customers into N clusters, highlighting at-risk vs loyal segments.
